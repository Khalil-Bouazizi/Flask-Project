This project involved designing and deploying a full-stack web application that automates the conversion of Excel/CSV files into SQL-compatible formats. The app was built using Flask, containerized using Docker, and deployed on Microsoft Azure. DevOps practices were applied to ensure a robust CI/CD pipeline and secure deployments.

Key Features
🐍 Flask Web Application: Upload Excel/CSV files and automatically convert them to SQL insert statements.

🐳 Dockerized Deployment: Containerized for consistent development and production environments.

☁️ Azure Hosting: Deployed using Azure Web Apps and Azure Container Registry for scalability.

🔁 CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins: Automated testing, security scanning, and deployment.

🔎 SonarQube Integration: Enforced code quality standards.

🛡 Trivy Scanning: Detected vulnerabilities in Docker images.

🚀 Deployment Optimization: Reduced deployment time by 30% via DockerHub caching and streamlined Jenkins pipelines.

CI/CD Stack
Jenkins: Pipeline-as-code (Jenkinsfile) for build, test, scan, and deploy stages

SonarQube: Code quality checks (static code analysis)

Trivy: Container vulnerability scanning

DockerHub: Image storage and versioning

Azure: Application hosting and container management

Outcomes
✅ Deployment time reduced by 30%
✅ Improved code quality and security visibility
✅ Hands-on experience with modern DevOps tools and cloud platforms
